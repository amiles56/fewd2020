Front End Web Dev Final Project
created by Drew Miles

This webpage is a gallery for saving and displaying interesting things you find around the web.  You can Add new things in your gallery or manage the things that you have previously stored in Delphi's Gallery.  You can even use the artists or generes page to limit the things you see in the gallery to things that were created by a specfic artist or fall into a particular genre.

The 3 requirements I intend to fulfill are:
CSS:
1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item

2. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop

3. Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table

JX:
1. Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section)

2. Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents on your page
